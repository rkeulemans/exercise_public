    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this notebook, you are about to create some (linear algebra) exercises using the developed `Exercise` Python library aiming to facilitate authoring parameterized mathematics exercises at a high level of abstraction (i.e. access to a scripting language and the libraries available in there, including as SymPy, NumPy and Matplotlib).\n",
    "Created exercises can be 'played' inline, using the web-based player developed as part of this project.\n",
    "Roughly speaking this project is new combination of existing approaches: MEGUA-like parameterized text, SymPy's CAS functionality and exercise-setup as used by Grasple and SageMath for working with mathematical objects in notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to evaluate the usability of the developed library and the authoring setup (this notebook).\n",
    "Note that by no means you or your skills are being tested, it is by no means a problem if exercises are left uncompleted.\n",
    "Notes, comments and suggestions are very welcome, please write these either as code-comments or in the Markdown cells in the notebook.\n",
    "All feedback will be reported and reflected upon anonymously.\n",
    "Completing the notebook should take about 30 minutes, depending on setup time, prior knowledge about this project, familiarity with linear algebra and the supplied frameworks etc.\n",
    "Please download the notebook when done and send it by email.\n",
    "After completion, in a brief semi-structured interview, you can further elaborate upon your experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start creating exercises, please replace the `URL` and `TOKEN` in the block above with the strings supplied by email:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Exercise.URL = \"<supplied_url_here>\"\n",
    "Exercise.TOKEN = \"<supplied_token_here>\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumptions:\n",
    "- Familiarity with Python, Markdown, LaTeX\n",
    "- Familiarity with Jupyter-Notebook\n",
    "- Familiarity with the very basics of linear algebra\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendations:\n",
    "- Use Binder (www.mybinder.org) to edit this notebook, if you prefer local setup instead, see README.md.\n",
    "- Use Firefox, the iFrame exercise player embeddings do not work in Chrome or Safari due to global cross-origin policies set by these browsers.\n",
    "- Other browsers (Chrome, Safari) can still be used, however, playing exercises is only possible outside of the notebook by clicking the generated exercise links, which is rather inconvenient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "- Documentation can for the Python library can be found in the `html` directory.\n",
    "- Within Jupyter-Notebook, function documentation can be viewed by writing a `?` after the function, like so: `Exercise(\"What is $1 + 1$?\").add_answer?`\n",
    "- Within exercises, only inline math notation is supported.\n",
    "- Preview-exercises are purged from the server from time to time, don't expect long-term, persistent availability of any played exercises.\n",
    "- Please skip an exercise in case completing it requires more than a few minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Happy coding ;)"

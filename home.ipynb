    "##### Opportunity\n",
    "The internet is full of freely accessible, high quality computer science learning resources.\n",
    "Think about YouTube videos, MIT OpenCourseWare, Medium posts and many many more.\n",
    "If you want to learn machine learning from first principles, highly informative material is available, like [Stanford CS231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) and [Caltech CS156](https://work.caltech.edu/telecourse).\n",
    "The interaction with you, the receiver, is rather unidirectional, your understanding is evaluated infrequently, practice requires opening your book and manually checking your answers.\n",
    "Wouldn't it be cool to practice the procedures and concepts in an interactive way, with loads of exercises?\n",
    "That's what this project is all about!\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Approach\n",
    "In essence, the goal of this project is investigating the possibilities for creating open answer mathematics exercises by using [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html), Markdown and LaTeX for authoring exercise content and the [MathLive]() formula editor for answering. \n",
    "Exercises can be authored and answered like so:\n",

    "##### Stack\n",
    "Brief overview of technologies used in this project:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [SymPy](https://github.com/sympy/sympy) (and [NumPy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy)) to represent mathematical objects and derive corresponding LaTeX code for exercise contents and answers;\n",
    "- [Markdown](https://github.com/Python-Markdown/markdown) for Python to generate HTML from Markdown strings;\n",
    "- Elixir + [Phoenix LiveView](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.html) to serve the exercise player;\n",
    "- [MathLive](https://github.com/arnog/mathlive) as a formula editor for answer formulation and rendering LaTeX math notation in exercises;\n",
    "- [Primer.style](https://primer.style) for as a CSS framework and [TOCBot](https://github.com/tscanlin/tocbot) to built a table of contents + scrollspy. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Implementation\n",
    "Highlights of the interesting parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. SymPy provides the [`latex`](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/tutorial/printing.html) printing function to get LaTeX corresponding to mathematical objects (like matrices, integrals etc.)\n",
    "2. SymPy provides the parse_latex function for converting LaTeX expressions to SymPy objects.\n",
